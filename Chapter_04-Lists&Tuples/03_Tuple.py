'''
A tuple in Python is an immutable ordered collection of elements.

Tuples are similar to lists, but unlike lists, they cannot be changed after their creation (i.e., they are immutable).
Tuples can hold elements of different data types.
The main characteristics of tuples are being ordered, heterogeneous and immutable.

# Creating a tuple: A tuple is created by placing all items inside parantheses (), separated by commas.
# A tuple can have  any number of item and they can be different data types.

tup = ()
print(tuple)

# Using String
tup = ('Pavan' 'Gupta')
print(tuple)

# Using List
li = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
print(tuple(li))

# Using Built-in Function
tup = tuple('Sakshi')
print(tup)
