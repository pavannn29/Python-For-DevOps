'''
1. Opening file: we can use open() function, which requires file-path and mode as arguments:
    Syntax: file = open('filename.txt', 'mode')

filename.txt: name (or path) of the file to be opened.
mode: mode in which you want to open the file (read, write, append, etc.)

'''

# Basic Example: Opening a file

f = open("file.txt")
data = f.read()
print(data)
f.close()


'''
2. Writing file: writing to a file is done using the mode "w". This creates a new file if it doesnâ€™t exist, or overwrites the existing file if it does. The write() method is used to add content. After writing, make sure to close the file.

'''

# Basic Example: Writing a file

st = "Hello dosto, Kaise ho?"

f = open("myfile.txt", "w")

f.write(st)

f.close()

'''
Other method to read a file:

We can also use f.readline() function to read one full line at a time.

f.readline() # Read one line from the file.

'''

# Basic Example: f.readline.()

line = f.readline()
while (line != ""):
    print(line)
    line = f.readline()

f.close()
