The following rules apply to writing variable names in Python:

1. Allowed Characters: Variable names can only contain alphanumeric characters (A-z, 0-9) and underscores (\_). 
2. Starting Character: A variable name must start with a letter (A-z) or an underscore (\_). 
It cannot start with a number. 
3. Case-Sensitivity: Python variable names are case-sensitive. For example, myVar, myvar, and MYVAR are 
considered three distinct variables.
4. No Spaces: Spaces are not permitted within variable names. To separate words, 
use underscores (e.g., my_variable).
