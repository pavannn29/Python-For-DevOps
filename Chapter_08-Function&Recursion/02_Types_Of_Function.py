'''
Python functions can be categorized into several types based on their origin and how they are defined and used:

1. Built-in Functions(Already present in python): These are pre-defined functions that are part of the Python language and are readily available for use without any explicit definition. Examples include print(), len(), sum(), max(), min(), type(), range(), etc.

2. User-defined Functions(Defined by the user): These are functions created by the programmer to perform specific tasks. They are defined using the def keyword. 

def GoodDay():
    userName = input("Enter your username: ")
    print(f"Hello {userName}, Have a Good Day!")

GoodDay()
